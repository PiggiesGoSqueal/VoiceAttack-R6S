# VoiceAttack-R6S
VoiceAttack profiles for Rainbow Six Siege.

These profiles require the paid version of VoiceAttack.

## R6S-Full Profile:
Designed to be used for those whom do not have access to a mouse or keyboard. It allows looking around and moving around using just your voice. However, there are limitations with what can be done using VoiceAttack. Parrot.py is recommended for best use (but is less beginner friendly).

## R6S-Lite Profile:
Designed to be used alongside a mouse and keyboard. Reduces the amount of manual input required when in non-competitive situations (e.g. droning the map or running toward the building). However, for looking around and fighting you'll need a mouse and keyboard.

For support and bug reports please contact me on Discord. My username is "PiggiesGoSqueal" (no ID).

## Versions:
Since the Lite version only contains a sub-section of the commands in the Full version, each release will contain a Full and Lite version using the same version numbers to reflect they are both on the same page with their updates.

## Improvement Steps:
None currently.

## Reminder for self:
Keep the list of voice commands below updated for any new additions. When pushing new versions post them as official releases.

## Voice Processing Speed
Note some words are shortened in order to make them easier to say quickly in the heat of battle. It also allows the software to process the commands more quickly. E.g. "Stop Sprinting" was shortened to "stint" or "stop". However, if you feel it is still too slow to play the game then it is recommended to use Parrot.py on Github instead (less beginner friendly but quicker at processing).

For voice commands that include a '2' I also detect 'too' in case it misunderstands it.
