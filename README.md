# VoiceAttack-R6S
 A VoiceAttack profile for Rainbow Six Siege

v0.1.0 on 2/10/2024:
Implemented most base voice commands to play Rainbow Six Siege.

Upload to a VoiceAttack profile to see the command list. Includes controls and voice commands for looking around. A mouse is preferred but shouldn't be required. 

For support and bug reports please contact me on Discord. My username is "PiggiesGoSqueal" (no ID).

Improvement Steps:
1. Implement a way to use abilities with voice.
2. Consider increasing consistency in voice commands. E.g. having multi-commands use "1;2;3" instead of "quick;short;long". Although variety may be good for memory and voice detection for the program. We'll see.
3. Compile a list of voice commands in a text file for ease of access and memorization. Perhaps can generate with VoiceAttack? Still learning the software.
